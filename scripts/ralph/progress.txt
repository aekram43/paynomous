## Codebase Patterns
- Project structure: Backend (NestJS), Frontend (Next.js), Rust services in separate directories
- Docker Compose used for local development infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, UI tools)
- TypeScript typecheck script in package.json: `npm run typecheck`
- Environment variables stored in .env file (gitignored), with .env.example for reference
- Health checks configured for all Docker services

## 2026-02-05 04:15 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  * Created project structure with backend/, frontend/, rust-services/ directories
  * Created Docker Compose file with PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7, and Redis Commander UI
  * Configured environment variables in .env and .env.example files
  * Set up basic NestJS backend with TypeScript configuration
  * Created health endpoint in app.controller.ts
  * Added typecheck script to package.json

- Files changed:
  * docker-compose.yml (created)
  * .env.example (created)
  * .gitignore (created)
  * backend/package.json (created)
  * backend/tsconfig.json (created)
  * backend/src/main.ts (created)
  * backend/src/app.module.ts (created)
  * backend/src/app.controller.ts (created)
  * backend/src/app.service.ts (created)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  * Docker Compose services require correct image names - used `rediscommander/redis-commander:latest` for Redis UI instead of non-existent BullMQ Board images
  * Docker Desktop must be running before executing docker-compose commands
  * Health checks use `condition: service_healthy` for dependencies between services
  * Basic NestJS structure includes: main.ts (bootstrap), app.module.ts (root module), app.controller.ts (endpoints), app.service.ts (business logic)
  * TypeScript strict mode is disabled in initial setup for easier development
  * All Docker services use the `agentrooms-network` bridge network for inter-service communication
  * PostgreSQL and Redis are accessible on standard ports (5432, 6379)
  * Redis Commander UI is accessible on port 3001 (mapped from internal port 8081)
